# LlamaParse + Cortex Search

This [notebook](https://github.com/sfc-gh-jreini/llama-parse-cortex-search/blob/main/llama-cloud-snowflake.ipynb) walks through how to parse a complex report with LlamaParse, how to load it in Snowflake, and how to create a Cortex Search service on top of the parsed data (in Snowflake).

At the end, we link to a quickstart you can follow to build a complete RAG app on top of the search service.
