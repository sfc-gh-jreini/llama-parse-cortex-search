       " '# Table of Contents\\n\\nOur platform is used globally by organizations of all sizes across a broad range of industries. As of January 31, 2025, we had 11,159 total customers, increasing from 9,384 customers as of January 31, 2024. Our customer count is subject to adjustments for acquisitions, consolidations, spin-offs, and other market activity, and we present our total customer count for historical periods reflecting these adjustments. Our platform has been adopted by many of the world’s largest organizations that view Snowflake as a key strategic partner in their cloud and data transformation initiatives. As of January 31, 2025, our customers included 745 of the Forbes Global 2000, based on the 2024 Forbes Global 2000 list, and those customers contributed approximately 42% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025. Our Forbes Global 2000 customer count is subject to adjustments for annual updates to the Global 2000 list by Forbes, as well as acquisitions, consolidations, spin-offs, and other market activity with respect to such customers, and we present our Forbes Global 2000 customer count for historical periods reflecting these adjustments.\\n\\n# Fiscal Year\\n\\nOur fiscal year ends on January 31. For example, references to fiscal 2025 refer to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025.\\n\\n# Impact of Macroeconomic Conditions\\n\\nOur business and financial condition have been, and may continue to be, impacted by adverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, high interest rates, and fluctuations or volatility in capital markets or foreign currency exchange rates. These conditions have caused, and may continue to cause, customers to rationalize budgets, prioritize cash flow management, including through shortened contract duration, and optimize consumption, including by reducing storage through shorter data retention policies. We are continuing to monitor the actual and potential effects of general macroeconomic conditions across our business. For additional details, see the section titled “Risk Factors.”\\n\\n# Convertible Senior Notes\\n\\nIn September 2024, we completed a private offering of $1.15 billion aggregate principal amount of 0% convertible senior notes due 2027 (2027 Notes) and $1.15 billion aggregate principal amount of 0% convertible senior notes due 2029 (2029 Notes, and together with the 2027 Notes, the Notes). The total proceeds from the issuance of the Notes were approximately $2.27 billion, net of $31.2 million of debt issuance costs.\\n\\nWe used a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to (i) pay the $195.5 million cost of the privately negotiated capped call transactions relating to each series of the Notes (Capped Calls) and (ii) repurchase $399.6 million of our common stock from purchasers of the Notes in the offering in privately negotiated transactions entered into in connection with the Notes offering at a purchase price of $112.50 per share.\\n\\nSee Note 10, “Convertible Senior Notes,” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.\\n\\n# Stock Repurchase Program\\n\\nIn February 2023, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $2.0 billion of our outstanding common stock. In August 2024, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $2.5 billion of our outstanding common stock and extended the expiration date of the stock repurchase program from March 2025 to March 2027. During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, we repurchased 14.8 million shares of our outstanding common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $1.9 billion, excluding transaction costs associated with the repurchases, at a weighted-average price of $130.87 per share. All repurchases were made in open market transactions, except for the 3.6 million shares of our outstanding common stock that were repurchased for $399.6 million from purchasers of the Notes in the offering in privately negotiated transactions entered into in connection with the Notes offering at a purchase price of $112.50 per share. As of January 31, 2025, $2.0 billion remained available for future repurchases under the stock repurchase program (exclusive of transaction costs associated with repurchases). See Note 10, “Convertible Senior Notes,” and Note 12, “Equity,” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.\\n\\nThe timing and amount of any repurchases will be determined by management based on an evaluation of market conditions and other factors. The program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion.',\n",
       " '# Table of Contents\\n\\n# We have a history of operating losses and may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future.\\n\\nWe have experienced net losses in each period since inception. We generated net losses of $1.3 billion, $838.0 million and $797.5 million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of January 31, 2025 and 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $7.3 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively. We expect our costs and expenses to increase in future periods. In particular, we intend to continue to invest significant resources to further develop our platform, expand our research and development teams, retain our employees, and acquire other businesses, including in the areas of data science, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. In addition, our platform currently operates on public cloud infrastructure provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure (Azure), and Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and our costs and gross margins are significantly influenced by the prices we are able to negotiate with these public cloud providers, which in certain cases are also our competitors. If we fail to meet any minimum commitments under our third-party cloud infrastructure agreements, we may be required to pay the difference, and our results of operations could be negatively impacted. We will also incur increased general and administrative expenses associated with our growth, including costs related to internal systems, operating as a public company, and targeting regulated industries or markets. Our efforts to grow our business have been and may continue to be costlier than we expect, or our revenue growth rate may be slower than we expect, and we may not be able to increase our revenue enough to offset the increase in operating expenses resulting from these investments. If we are unable to achieve and sustain profitability, or if we are unable to achieve the revenue growth that we expect from these investments, the value of our business and common stock may significantly decrease.\\n\\n# The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be harmed.\\n\\nThe markets in which we operate are rapidly evolving and highly competitive. In recent years, we have adopted open data formats like Apache Iceberg tables to allow customers to use our platform to process data stored in external customer-controlled environments outside of Snowflake, and we have introduced a significant number of new features and expanded into new product categories like artificial intelligence. These changes are driving increased competition, both because there is less customer “lock in” when our products are used in external environments, and also because we are competing across more product categories, each of which is subject to distinct customer requirements and preferences. Our success depends on our ability to continue to innovate in response to changing market dynamics.\\n\\nOur current competitors include:\\n\\n- large, well-established, public cloud providers that generally compete in all of our markets, including AWS, Azure, and GCP;\\n- less-established public and private cloud companies with products that compete in some or all of our markets;\\n- other established vendors of legacy database solutions or big data offerings; and\\n- new or emerging entrants seeking to develop competing technologies.\\n\\nWe compete based on various factors, including price, performance, product features, breadth of use cases, multi-cloud availability, brand recognition and reputation, customer support, and differentiated capabilities, including ease of implementation and data migration, ease of administration and use, scalability and reliability, data governance, security and compatibility with existing standards, programming languages, third-party products, and the ability to operate in hybrid environments. Many of our competitors have substantially greater brand recognition, customer relationships, and financial, technical, and other resources than we do, and may be able to respond more effectively than us to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards, customer requirements, and buying practices.

Such customers represented approximately 67% and 65% of our product revenue for the trailing 12 months ended January 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Within these customers, we had 110 and 39 customers with product revenue of greater than $5 million and $10 million, respectively, for the trailing 12 months ended January 31, 2025. The substantial majority of our revenue was derived from existing customers under capacity arrangements, which represented approximately 97% of our revenue for each of the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025 and 2024. The remainder was derived from on-demand arrangements and new customers under capacity arrangements. The preceding historical metrics reflect any adjustments for acquisitions, consolidations, spin-offs, and other market activity. For purposes of determining revenue derived from (i) customers with trailing 12-month product revenue greater than $1 million, (ii) new customers, and (iii) existing customers, we treat each customer account, including accounts for end-customers under a reseller arrangement, that has at least one corresponding capacity contract as a unique customer, and a single organization with multiple divisions, segments, or subsidiaries may be counted as multiple customers.\\n\\nProfessional services and other revenue increased $24.3 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, compared to the prior fiscal year, as we continued to expand our professional services organization to help our customers further realize the benefits of our platform.',\n",
